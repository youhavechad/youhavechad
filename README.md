### Hello beautiful people! 👋 A few things about me:

- 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of my full-time job, I’m working on buidling an ecommerce site using React, Next.js, GraphQL, Keystone 
- 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently learning Python and Machine Learning
- 💬&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me about increasing your digital accessibility
- 😄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun facts: I'm a vegan, I have done the Sydney BridgeClimb, I have ran a half-marathon
- :muscle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active roles at work: Software Engineer, Threat Modeling Lead on team, Accessiblity Lead on team

- :speech_balloon:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite accessiblity quotes:
> “The one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives. How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives just by doing our job a little better?”  ― Steve Krug
